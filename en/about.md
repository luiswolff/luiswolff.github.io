    interests: 'What am I interest in?'
    summary: 'As a Full-Stack Web-Developer I am interest in web-based enterprise software. I my opinion this are applications that fulfil business requirements. With this kind of software companies tries to design there processes more economical, improve the competitive position or acquire new business units. I think web-based enterprise software is mostly build on these three pillars: '
    web_development: '<b>Web-Development: </b>Intuitive user interfaces make software useful. The internet is built on the technologies HTTP, HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Such applications can be consumed by any browser.'
    bussines_logic: '<b>Business logic: </b>Operational goals could be reached by optimizing processes. Software needs to represent the business model and its transformation. With the language Java this could be reached with a platform independent approach.'
    database_development: '<b>Database: </b>Enterprise applications are based on data. With SQL we can ensure consistency and flexible adjustment. But also object orientated approaches could have advantages.'
    combination: 'In my opinion the tasks of a Full-Stack Web-Developer is to combine the three areas mentioned above so that operational challenges can be solved as efficiently as possible. It is less about to build very complex code structures, it is more about to build maintainable software, that can be adopt to new requirements quickly. Furthermore, it is less about to build my dream application, it is more about to know that my work is useful for the people that use it. I think software must simplify existing work flows and not just create new.'
    conclusion: 'Many of the ideas mentioned above are also part of the <a href="http://agilemanifesto.org/">agile manifesto</a>. I always try to develop according to these principles.'

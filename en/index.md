    welcome: My Blog about Java and Web technologies
    purpose-of-this-page: My name is Luis Wolff and I'm a enterprise developer. There for I'm interessed in web frameworks around the enterprise environment. In detail my focus is Java SE and Java EE, HTML5 as well as typical web protocols like HTTP. But I'm also interessted in relational and object orientated database.
    interests: 'What am I interest in?'
    summary: 'As an Enterprise-Developer I am interest in web-based enterprise software. I my opinion this are applications that fulfil business requirements. With this kind of software companies tries to design there processes more economical, improve the competitive position or acquire new business units. I think web-based enterprise software is mostly build on these three pillars:'
    web_development: '<b>Web-Development: </b>Intuitive user interfaces make software useful. The internet is built on the technologies HTTP, HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Such applications can be consumed by any browser.'
    bussines_logic: '<b>Business logic: </b>Operational goals will be reached with optimizing processes. Therefore, software must represent the business model and its processing. With the Java language this could be reached with a platform independent approach.'
    database_development: '<b>Database: </b>Enterprise applications are based on data. With SQL we can ensure consistency and flexible adjustment. But also object orientated approaches could have advantages.'
    combination: 'In my opinion the tasks of an Enterprise-Developer are to combine these three areas mentioned above so that business challenges can be solved as efficiently as possible. It is less about to build very complex code structures, it is more about to build maintainable software, that can be adopt to new requirements quickly. Furthermore, it is less about to work with the latest software frameworks, it is more about to know that the application is useful for the people that work with it. So the usage of software should provide a real value and not just new features.'
    conclusion: 'Many of the ideas mentioned above are also part of the <b>Manifesto for Agile Software Development</b>. This was defined by Kent Beck and other authors in the year 2001. The following value should lead to a better software development process. I''am also striving for fulfil these principles, when developing software: <ul><li>&ldquo;Individuals and interactions over processes and tools&rdquo;</li><li>&ldquo;Working software over comprehensive documentation&rdquo;</li><li>&ldquo;Customer collaboration over contract negotiation&rdquo;</li><li>&ldquo;Responding to change over following a plan&rdquo;</li></ul>'
